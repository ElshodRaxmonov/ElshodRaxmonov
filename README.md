# ðŸ˜„ Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elshod â€” Android Enthusiast & Code Explorer!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on polishing my Android development skills by building apps using **Kotlin**, **MVVM**, **Firebase**, and **Jetpack Compose**. My latest projects involve sleek UIs, smooth user flows, and learning the power of clean architecture.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything from **Navigation Component**, **Data Binding**, and **Dagger Hilt** to real-time syncing with **Firestore** â€” one commit at a time. I'm also exploring **competitive programming** to sharpen my problem-solving brain!

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for internship or remote works for boosting my skills in term of real-project case.
