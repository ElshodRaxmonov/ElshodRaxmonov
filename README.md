😄 Hi there 👋

I'm Elshod — Android Enthusiast & Code Explorer!

🔭 I’m currently working on polishing my Android development skills by building apps using **Kotlin**, **MVVM**, **Firebase**, and **Jetpack Compose**. My latest projects involve sleek UIs, smooth user flows, and learning the power of clean architecture.

🌱 I’m currently learning everything from **Navigation Component**, **Data Binding**, and **Dagger Hilt** to real-time syncing with **Firestore** — one commit at a time. I'm also exploring **competitive programming** to sharpen my problem-solving brain!

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Android apps that solve real-world problems — whether it’s a productivity tool, an educational app, or something experimental. If you have a cool idea and need a teammate, let’s build it together.

🤔 I’m looking for help with contributing to **open source Android projects** and understanding the best practices for **scalable app architecture**.

💬 Ask me about:
- Anything Kotlin 🧑‍💻
- Firebase integration 🔥
- XML layout tips & animation magic ✨
- Creating custom UI components 🧩

Feel free to DM me on [[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elshod-rakhmonov-8ab4561b5/))] or drop an issue on any of my repos — I'm always up for a coding chat!

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I once built an app just to track how often I said “I’ll fix it tomorrow.” Spoiler: It never got fixed... until now. 😅
